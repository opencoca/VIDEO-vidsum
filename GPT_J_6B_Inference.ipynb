            "## The Old Port of Montreal is a\u001b[0m perfect example of an abandoned waterfront—a space full of potential, barely taken advantage of. Once part of an industrial area, and then a commercial area, this district was mainly left to decay and become a space full of garbage, thus enhancing the image of a rustic, dirty, and slightly disreputable city.\n",
            "\n",
            "On the occasion of a series of events in 2016, this space was considered for the first time by the owner, Culture Québec, in conjunction with the city of Montreal, as a cultural site, within the framework of a pilot project aimed at using abandoned areas to develop new artistic and cultural initiatives. In this case, the theme is creative and experimental activities, using the existing infrastructure of the site and its history of waterfront activities.\n",
            "\n",
            "The first work developed on this site included the transformation of the Mirabito, the Café Rivard, and a small store into the Salomé Follet reading room and library, devoted to supporting and enriching reading practices in the city of Montreal. The aim was to preserve the city's material heritage and the space's history while increasing its visibility and offering a new vision of reading and leisure. The café and store were totally transformed using the space of the two rooftops of the building. The Café Rivard also serves as a meeting point for young Quebecois people living on the periphery. The information desk serves as a table for people waiting to be served and gives passersby more details about this space.\n",
            "\n",
            "The second development is also based on the idea that an abandoned area can be transformed into a place where creative cultural initiatives can flourish. Within the frame of this work, a workshop space was proposed for experimentation and production. This workshop will be based on the experience of the ceramic artist Hector Salomé Follet, who creates work with memory. With this workshop, Hector will develop his personal projects, which will then be shared with the community. As a first step, he will propose the creation of a small workshop that will be open to a broader public. In fact, the ideas of Hector Salomé Follet will be a key element in the creation of this unique space.\n",

            "When the Old Port was first established, a medieval quarter that comprised the borough of Montreal, it was the site of some of the city's most active enterprises in timber, textiles, paper, textiles, food processing and shipbuilding. After the 1867 fire, entrepreneurs built new commercial buildings along the walls and wooden quays. The south side of the Old Port remained the industrial area with small scale processing and manufacturing facilities. The northern and eastern part of the Old Port became a commercial centre with hotels, restaurants, commercial buildings and the commercial exchanges.\n",
            "\n",
            "The Old Port then evolved as part of an urban design process that involved a complete redesign of the commercial core area, complete with new traffic and lighting control, and the overall expansion of the scope of what was called the administrative centre of Montreal. This monumental move made the Old Port part of Montreal's commercial capital for a century.\n",
            "\n",
            "Over the last few decades, the Old Port has been undergoing another transformation with the return of heritage buildings, a revitalized culinary and cultural scene, a revitalized culture and shopping environment, a rise in personal and professional services, technology, life sciences, start-ups and more.\n",
            "\n",
            "## In the last decade, what challenges have the businesses and organizations operating in the Old Port and the city of Montreal faced?\n",
            "\n",
            "The decline of industries, the opening of new services, the many proposed changes in regulations and zoning, and the rise of real estate values and rental prices have all played a part in the increase in rental prices and the need to attract tenants.\n",
            "\n",
            "Within the Old Port, restaurants and shops have had to adjust to the increasing demand for dining options, changing tastes and consumer habits. The Old Port now also includes a number of cultural venues and artistic presentations, which has also resulted in the need to adapt the buildings to accommodate such activities.\n",
            "\n",
            "Lovers of the culinary arts will find the Old Port's new generation of restaurants well worth exploring. Boutiques, small businesses and social entrepreneurs need to find ways to ensure that their investment is profitable.\n",
            "\n",
            "## Can we recognize any progress in the overall health of the Old Port?\n",
            "\n",
            "Yes! The major event that marked the renewal of the Old Port of Montreal in the 2000s was the replacement of the grey granite and slate with gleaming glass and green on the green roof.\n",
            "\n",
            "## In general, what do we feel are the main issues that are limiting the opportunities and competitiveness of small businesses in the Old Port?\n",
            "\n",
            "We feel that a limiting factor for the development of businesses is the lack of available facilities. There is little space for growth. Larger companies have a larger footprint. Smaller businesses have a harder time securing their place in the market and of finding a more stable footing.\n",
            "\n",
            "Larger enterprises and organizations have the capacity to offer more facilities, which is not the case for many entrepreneurs and small businesses. Smaller enterprises and organizations have more constraints on available spaces and infrastructure and a harder time securing the space they need.\n",
            "\n",
            "The Old Port of Montreal has played a key role in the revitalization of its core. The redevelopment of the Old Port, with the addition of new services and infrastructures, and the overall transformation of the commercial capital of Montreal has been part of the city's strategy for growth and prosperity. The Old Port, the Old Port Commercial Centre (OPCC) and the Old Port Corporation (OPC) have come to play a significant role in the rebirth of the city.\n",
