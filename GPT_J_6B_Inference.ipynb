            "The Old Port of Montreal is a\u001b[0m good place to observe social issues – particularly the social and economic distance between the rich and the poor. People work in public spaces in strange ways, often without anyone else noticing. Is it possible to feel empathy for strangers who work for a living? Is it possible to share their experience without becoming emotionally overwhelmed by it? The spectator's sensitivity is subjected to a daily barrage of images and sounds. They have become objects in a dark theatrical game.\n",
            "\n",
            "Pierre Berton noted that \"these spaces, crammed with modern-day distractions, contribute to the psychic degradation of our civilization.\" (1) Perhaps one could say the same about this new economy of alienation that has evolved in the Old Port. Its \"dark theater\" is a space in which to develop strategies and programs to confront social problems in urban space and, for some, to confront a place in which the law was once nonexistent. The viewpoint of spectator is situated in the spatial margins of the city, while the workplace is conceived as a boundary to oneself. It is at these places that a conception of self emerges which is supported by the workings of alienation. In short, these are spaces in which one can observe the ego.\n",
            "\n",
            "I want to question the idea that \"alienation is the philosophical core of contemporary economic and social practices\" (2) and I want to demonstrate that the forces of alienation in society are already more deeply ingrained than one might think. This idea suggests that \"withdrawal\" (Ladurie's (3) phrase for escape from the city) is to be found in a period of \"panic\" after World War I and only continued to develop in the 1930s, when work became a way to create \"a'sense of self'\" (4). Today, with the advent of work in new ways (new businesses, new methods of management, globalization), it is again possible to speak of a culture of withdrawal. As one writer put it, \"a child of the '70s is a child of the '80s, who grew up with a sense of insecurity and a feeling of insecurity\" (5). But today the meaning of work is not merely the search for security. Rather, work is being transformed into a way to enrich one's self, and this transformation is reinforced by the current construction of \"new communities of leisure\" (6).\n",
            "\n",
            "In the Old Port, workplaces are sites for making work visible and for seeing how others work. Because the working world is both messy and invisible, it is part of a psychic economy which may be as dark as \"theater.\" These \"dark theaters\" are also spaces of \"formless\" activity. They are spatial containers which offer a reflective, self-sufficient space for observing work and for working in a new way.\n",
            "\n",
            "## A NEW WAY TO BE A SPATIAL WORKER\n",
            "\n",
            "If you approach one of the spaces of the Old Port, you'll see everything but you won't see yourself. The space in which we work and play is already framed by visual and audio distractions (spotlights, mirrors, images on display) in a way that obscures this dynamic process of perception. Our everyday perceptions of work involve the transformation of those things that occur spontaneously in our space into images and words. As the space is transformed, new technologies mediate reality. We are governed by a culture that demands and receives ever more information in order to have its work done. Because our selves are tied up with this work (in the same way as time was once tied up with the material world) it is impossible to believe that these activities are going on independently of ourselves. We cannot know or feel what others feel; our own feelings and emotions are what they are because they are engaged by these things.\n",
            "\n",
            "It is difficult to grasp the fact that our ordinary work is, in essence, imaginative and in the doing of that work we act as if our work were art. But, because this \"work\" is not included in our daily realities, it is \"invisible\" to most of us. Our work is invisible because we are involved in our own image (that is, the unique construction of our selves) and do not see ourselves as those who work. Moreover, \"if people don't believe they're working, they don't have to (7).\" These two statements are important. As we become convinced of the fact that we are workers, that is, we act as if we were, we cease to believe that we are.\n",
            "\n",
            "When we want to work as a social animal, we become so firmly rooted in our places as beings who work that we forget that we are not solely ourselves. It is easy to forget this when we are in the midst of it and we are the only ones who work. This activity is, quite literally, a way of becoming an object and, as such, it is alienating. We live in a culture that places a high value on the individual and, because we can never see ourselves as having been totally constructed by our activities, this construction is represented as something permanent and final. It is as if we were aware of the fact that our work is the \"stuff\" we are made of but the fact that we make it up creates a continuity between ourselves and the events we generate that is not unlike a human being's consciousness of its body.\n",
            "\n",
            "I would like to illustrate the fact that this process of transformation is even more pronounced for some \"work places.\" One of them is a place of primary production: the maquette factory. This is a work place in which an automatic machinist uses an intricate metal piece that resembles a bowl to fashion a giant container. The final result is a solid, imminently useful object. But this manufacturing process is one of the sites of human activity that are hidden from view (they are \"natural\" places of work); if we look at them, we are suddenly faced with the possibility of a view of self. We are taken to the place where our perception is transformed. We are moved from the things we have to the world in which we are. One can observe this transformation at work in the process of making a maquette. At first, the automatic machine is controlled by a complex series of switches and an operator changes these switches while maintaining a neutral distance. Next, the machine operator and machinist have to work together, helping each other, and the machine is changed, even though it does not actually \"change.\" The maquette is something which is made through an interplay between the machine and the operator, and this activity of making creates the existence of an object which is in itself open to our gaze. I wish to emphasize that it is only when we stop working that the object is \"made.\" Before the process of making begins, we are connected to a source of energies that we are unable to describe. The object that has just appeared to us (the one which only exists through a series of operations) is obviously an image of our world; it is an image we have created and it is, at the same time, a window onto the world. It is in this way that the solidity of the object we have made acquires its characteristic openness. The result is that, when we work, our sense of self is re-created.\n",
            "\n",
            "## SEVERAL POSITIONS ON THE SCALE OF LIFE\n",
            "\n",
            "Let's take this idea one step further and consider the fact that the maquette is also a piece of art. The maquette is a creation, a work of art. Yet it is also a construct made of metal, made of man. This is why it has its own coherence and internal logic, that is, it has an internal consistency. This object represents the past and the future. If we think about the process of manufacturing, we will see that the whole thing is unpredictable. We could situate this place of work at the center of all the activity that takes place in the Old Port and we could say, \"This is what artists do.\" But I would like to see this concept of \"work as art\" move into other areas of the city. I would like to understand how this work is represented and represented for a world in which there is an apparent need to fill time with something.\n",
            "\n",
            "For example, a view of the world could be developed from a perspective of a mundane \"consumer.\" If we look at what happens in one particular place in the Old Port, we will see that it is important for this work to be shown. At any moment, a number of employees take different jobs at the space of the workshop and they are there at different times. They seem to be following different schedules. On some days, you will see a supervisor and a worker making something together; on other days, you may see only one person. The situation creates the appearance that it is only one of those people who is working. By the same token, one might well wonder what is happening to those who appear to be idle. Indeed, when one views the place as a consumer, one might even wonder who owns it.\n",
            "\n",
            "If the workshop is considered as an \"alienation factory,\" as a space in which we become enclosed, working hard to save what we have accumulated (2), it could also be considered as an extension of our private space. (8) Because the \"work\" is there, we have something to see and be afraid of. By observing it from a distance, we might watch our reflection in its mirror and see what we have created. This space could be one of the spaces where we are involved in a process of self-reflection. The distance between the observer and the observed seems to be missing here. But, in this case, because the observer is a \"being\" who is not the object, but the creator of the object, the observer and the observed are involved in a different way. I have been drawn into the secret world that I have created.\n",
            "\n",
            "Today, we have become \"objects\" and the spaces in which we work are very often of interest\n"
