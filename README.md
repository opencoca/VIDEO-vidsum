```

Please note that vidsum requires the following packages to be installed:

- [pysrt](https://github.com/byroot/pysrt)
- [imageio](https://imageio.github.io/)
- [moviepy](https://zulko.github.io/moviepy/)
- [pytube](https://github.com/nficano/pytube)
- [sumy](https://github.com/miso-belica/sumy)

Prerequisites:

-   Install Required Packages:

    Before starting, ensure you have the necessary packages installed. Run the following command in your terminal:

    ```

    pip install -r requirements.txt

    ```

Usage:

Generating a Summary from a Local Video File and Subtitle:

1.  Specify video and subtitle files:

    ```

    python sum.py -i <video_file_path> -s <subtitle_file_path>

    ```

    -   ReplaceÂ `<video_file_path>`Â with the actual path to your video file (e.g.,Â `sample.mp4`).
    -   ReplaceÂ `<subtitle_file_path>`Â with the path to the corresponding subtitle file (e.g.,Â `subtitle.srt`).
    

Summarizing a YouTube Video:
============================

1.  Provide the video URL:

    ```

    python sum.py -u <youtube_video_url>

    ```

    -   ReplaceÂ `<youtube_video_url>`Â with the actual URL of the YouTube video you want to summarize.

Optional: Retaining Downloaded YouTube Video and Subtitles:

-   To keep the downloaded video and subtitles after summarization, add theÂ `-k`Â flag:

    ```

    python sum.py -u <youtube_video_url> -k

    ```

**Key Points:**

-   TheÂ `sum.py`Â script handles both local video files and YouTube videos.
-   For YouTube videos, it automatically downloads the video and subtitles (if available).
-   TheÂ `-k`Â flag is optional and only used to preserve downloaded YouTube content.

**Additional Notes:**

-   Ensure you have a stable internet connection for summarizing YouTube videos.
-   The quality of the summary depends on the quality of the input video and subtitles.
-   Consider exploring additional options or parameters offered by theÂ `sum.py`Â script for further customization.
